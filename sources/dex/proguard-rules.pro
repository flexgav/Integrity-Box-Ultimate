# R8 keep rules for the IntegrityBox spoofing dex.

# These pin everything reached from outside the dex (native JNI by name, or the
# JCA framework by reflection). Everything else is fair game for R8 to shrink,
# optimize and obfuscate.
#
#  - EntryPoint / EntryPointVending public methods: called from native
#    (main.cpp) via FindClass + GetStaticMethodID with fixed descriptors.
#  - CustomKeyStoreSpi: registered by class name in CustomProvider and
#    instantiated by the JCA framework (no-arg ctor + overridden engine* methods).
#  - CustomPackageInfoCreator: public ctor invoked from EntryPoint.
#  - CustomProvider: getService is the JCA override.
#
# Renaming the package or the kept method signatures REQUIRES a matching change
# in main.cpp and a zygisk-buildkit rebuild — see sources/dex/README.md.
